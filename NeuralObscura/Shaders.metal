/*
 The input texture has four 16-bit floats per pixel, in the range 0.0...1.0.
 This shader function converts those floats to the range -128...127.

 The values we subtract from the R/G/B components are the mean R/G/B values
 across the set of images that the neural network was trained on.

 The alpha component of outColor is not important, since our MPSImages only
 use the first 3 feature channels.

 NOTE: We flip RGB textures to BGR (inColor.x and inColor.z get swapped),
 since the tool that was used to train the network, Caffe, uses images with
 BGR pixels. Therefore outColor.x is always B and outColor.y is always R.
