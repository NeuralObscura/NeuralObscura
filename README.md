# Neural Obscura

## Objectives

The project seeks to build a general purpose, fast, modern GPU based Deep Neural Network framework.

Goals:

1. Be fast enough to be able to operate in realtime / near realtime, supporting live video processing.
1. Be modern enough to support cutting edge Deep Learning techniques.
1. Be general purpose enough to make a variety of models effective.
1. Be able to support loading models trained on a computer from popular frameworks, for use on the device.

## End Game

- Create demonstration app(s) that effectively use the framework.
  - Style Transfer
  - Classifier
- Attempt to solicit VC interest and secure funding
- Open source if unable to do so.
